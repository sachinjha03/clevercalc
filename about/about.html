          <h3>SIP Calculator – Systematic Investment Plan Calculator</h3>
          <p>
            Prospective investors can think that SIPs and mutual funds are the
            same. However, SIPs are merely a method of investing in mutual
            funds, the other method being a lump sum. A SIP calculator is a tool
            that helps you determine the returns you can avail when parking your
            funds in such investment tools. Systematic Investment Plan or SIP is
            a process of investing a fixed sum of money in mutual funds at
            regular intervals. SIPs usually allow you to invest weekly,
            quarterly, or monthly.
